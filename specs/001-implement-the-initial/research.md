# Phase 0: Research & Best Practices

## Technical Decisions

### Landing Page Conversion Optimization
**Decision**: Follow SaaS landing page best practices with hero section, feature highlights, social proof, and clear pricing tiers
**Rationale**: Landing page conversion rates directly impact SaaS growth; following proven patterns reduces risk
**Alternatives considered**: Custom approach vs proven frameworks - chose proven patterns for reliability

### Authentication Architecture
**Decision**: AWS Amplify Auth (Cognito) with Google OAuth provider and custom ShadCN-styled components
**Rationale**: Integrated with Amplify Gen 2, handles security complexity, scales automatically, supports social providers
**Alternatives considered**: NextAuth.js, Auth0 - chose Amplify for ecosystem integration and constitutional compliance

### Payment Processing Architecture
**Decision**: Stripe embedded checkout with subscription management
**Rationale**: Industry standard, handles PCI compliance, excellent subscription support
**Alternatives considered**: PayPal, Square - chose Stripe for SaaS-optimized features

### State Management
**Decision**: React state + Amplify DataStore for global state
**Rationale**: No additional dependencies required, integrates with GraphQL subscriptions
**Alternatives considered**: Redux, Zustand - chose built-in solution for simplicity

### Styling Approach
**Decision**: ShadCN/ui components + Tailwind CSS utilities
**Rationale**: Constitutional requirement, provides design system consistency
**Alternatives considered**: Chakra UI, Material-UI - chose ShadCN for constitutional compliance

## Architecture Patterns

### Multi-tenancy Strategy
**Pattern**: Row-level security with tenant ID in all data models
**Implementation**: DynamoDB with tenant-scoped GSI indexes
**Benefits**: Data isolation, scalable, cost-effective

### API Design Pattern
**Pattern**: GraphQL-first with Amplify Gen 2 auto-generated resolvers
**Implementation**: Schema-driven development with TypeScript codegen
**Benefits**: Type safety, real-time subscriptions, optimistic updates

### Component Architecture
**Pattern**: Atomic design with ShadCN base components
**Structure**:
- Atoms: ShadCN primitives (Button, Input, Card)
- Molecules: Feature-specific combinations (PricingCard, UserProfile)
- Organisms: Page sections (PricingSection, DashboardOverview)
- Templates: Layout components (AuthLayout, DashboardLayout)

### Performance Optimization
**Pattern**: Next.js App Router with strategic SSR/SSG
**Implementation**:
- Landing page: SSG for speed
- Admin area: SSR for personalization
- API routes: Server components where possible

## Best Practices

### TypeScript Integration
- Strict mode enabled
- Amplify codegen for GraphQL types
- Component prop interfaces
- API response type definitions

### Security Considerations
- Server-side input validation
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Secure environment variable handling
- Content Security Policy headers

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Component logic and utility functions
- Integration tests: API contracts and user flows
- E2E tests: Critical subscription workflows
- Contract tests: GraphQL schema validation

### Performance Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Lighthouse CI integration
- Bundle size monitoring
- Database query optimization

## Technology Research

### Next.js 14 App Router
- Server components for performance
- Route groups for organization
- Loading/error boundaries
- Streaming for improved UX

### Amplify Gen 2 Features
- GraphQL with auto-generated resolvers
- Real-time subscriptions
- File storage with access controls
- Lambda function integration
- Social provider integration (Google OAuth)

### Amplify Auth with Google OAuth
- Cognito User Pools with Google as identity provider
- Automatic account linking for same email addresses
- Token management and refresh handling
- Custom UI components for OAuth flows
- Fallback to email/password authentication

### ShadCN Component Library
- Accessible by default
- Customizable via CSS variables
- Tree-shakeable bundle
- Dark mode support
- Custom OAuth button components

### Stripe Integration
- Embedded checkout forms
- Subscription lifecycle webhooks
- Customer portal for self-service
- Usage-based billing support

### Google OAuth Integration
- Google Cloud Console setup required
- OAuth 2.0 client configuration
- Scopes: profile, email (minimal)
- PKCE flow for security
- Redirect URI configuration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Amplify Gen 2 learning curve
- **Mitigation**: Follow official documentation, start with simple schema

- **Risk**: Stripe integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use embedded components, implement webhook validation

- **Risk**: Google OAuth configuration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use Amplify Auth built-in social providers, follow AWS documentation

- **Risk**: Account linking conflicts (same email, different providers)
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper account linking strategy, clear error messages

- **Risk**: Performance degradation
- **Mitigation**: Implement monitoring early, optimize bundle size

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: Poor conversion rates
- **Mitigation**: A/B testing framework, analytics integration

- **Risk**: Subscription management complexity
- **Mitigation**: Leverage Stripe's built-in customer portal

## Research Conclusions

All technical context items have been resolved. The chosen architecture aligns with constitutional requirements and provides a solid foundation for a maintainable SaaS application. The technology stack is proven, well-documented, and suitable for the scale requirements.

**Status**: âœ… All unknowns resolved, ready for Phase 1 design
