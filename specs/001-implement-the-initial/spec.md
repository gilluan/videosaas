# Feature Specification: Initial SaaS Structure

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-the-initial`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement the initial saas structure with:
  Modern landing page to this microsaas, following this guide: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/my-step-by-step-guide-to-landing-pages-that-convert-OICZzSx2yFPUXNjALmGQ
  The landing page should have a button to signup and a pricing section with 3 stripe plans to subscription.
  The admin area should contain these sections:
  * User profile
  * Dashboard
  * Settings
Configure stripe end to end with checkout page using embedded form
Customize cognito login with shadcn style
Add login with google provider"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A prospective customer visits the landing page to learn about the SaaS product, selects a subscription plan from the pricing section, creates an account through the signup process (either with email/password or Google login), completes payment via the checkout page, and then accesses the admin area to manage their profile, view dashboard metrics, and configure settings.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they review the landing page content and pricing options, **Then** they understand the product value proposition and available subscription tiers
2. **Given** a visitor decides to purchase, **When** they click the signup button and select a pricing plan, **Then** they are guided through account creation and payment processing
3. **Given** a user has completed signup and payment, **When** they log into the system, **Then** they can access their admin dashboard with profile, dashboard, and settings sections
4. **Given** an existing user wants to log in, **When** they use their credentials (email/password or Google) on the styled login form, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to their admin area
5. **Given** a user wants to change their subscription, **When** they access the billing section, **Then** they can modify their plan through the payment system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when payment processing fails during checkout?
- How does the system handle users who abandon the signup process midway?
- What occurs when a user's subscription expires or is cancelled?
- How does the system manage users accessing restricted areas without proper authentication?
- What happens when Google authentication fails or is unavailable?
- How does the system handle users who have both email/password and Google accounts with the same email address?
